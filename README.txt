Project: From Mars with Love
Creator: Alex Kruger
Description: This project was completed for DALI Lab's developer application.
The project uses the NASA and Twilio APIs to send a message to a group of
subscribed phone numbers with a photo from the Curiosity rover's voyages from the previous
day. If I had more time to work on this project, I would create a ReactJS front end that
allows users to subscribe or unsibscribe their phone number. There would also be a section
to browse through the rover's previous photos.
